            Hi there! I'm a developer with a passion for coding meaningful user
            experiences. I stuided software engineering, where I honed my skills
            in understanding the intersection of technology and user needs. This
            educational foundation laid the groundwork for my career in the
            dynamic field of develompment. Over the years, I've delved into
            diverse industries. My specialization lies in Apps development with
            Angular, where I've had the opportunity to create and supporting
            intuitive apps and seamless interactions across various digital
            platforms
